Team Members: Kopo Oromeng, Jonathan Hicks, Dan Nguyen,Janina Boecher, Kristina Rainich   

All members contributed constructively and helped to make sure that everyone was on the same page. We went over the first few sections of the assignment together and finished the rest independetly.

Kopo Oromeng: I had worked on sections of the assignment before meeting the group, but I was struggling to merge and then index the different stocks. Kristina was very helpful and portions of the code used for this assignment were from her. I debugged and troubleshot the code independently. My key takeaways from the actual assignment/data analysis are included at the bottom of the code.
