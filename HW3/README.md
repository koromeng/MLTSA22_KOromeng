**Homework 3** - Using ARMA and ARIMA models to forecast stock prizes.

I worked on most of this homework by myself hence the late submission (apologies). I have a better grasp of the models now having spent a lot of time debugging my code.
However I think I could benefit from briefly going over this exercise in class, discusing the results and takeaways.

I did briefly meet with *Janina and Kristina* over the weekend/Monday, but we were all a little behind and ended up spending time going over the questions.
